This is a simple tutorial on how to use Atom X.

Step 1: Open 1v1.LOL.

Step 2: Run Atom X.

Step 3: Press inject .

Step 4: Have fun using Atom X!

PS: You must use steamdb, revert to il2cpp version of 1v1.lol

then Atom X will work. But note that using anything other than the visuals and changing circle size,

will probably crash the game. So it's recommended that you only use those for protection from getting banned.

After almost every game it will crash because you are connecting to players on the current version,

while you are on an outdated verison. If this happens, don't freak out, simply relaunch the game, and reinject.

Stay safe, use at your own risk, and have fun!
